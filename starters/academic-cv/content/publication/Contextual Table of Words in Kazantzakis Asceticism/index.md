# abstract: Google Maps and Google Earth were milestones in the evolution of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A new era of 3D virtual geo-referenced worlds began. The need of exploration and creation personalized virtual tours is imperative. This work implements a best viewing algorithm for presenting a 3D model by considering both semantic and geometric features of the 3D model. The camera trajectory is estimated by respecting the user's preferences using a personalized entropy-based measurement. Moreover, the camera speed is adjusted properly based on the complexity of the projected view of the model.
